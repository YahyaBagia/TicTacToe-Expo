<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="ReadMeAssets/WebScreenshot.png" alt="Screenshot">

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game to be played against the computer or another player. While there are greate implementations of Tic-Tac-Toe are available on the internet, mine is just a small contribution to the list of open source implementations. It was made as a part of practicing react-native with [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [expo](https://www.expo.io/).
